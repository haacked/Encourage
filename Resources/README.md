# Encourage

## What is it?

A whimsical extension to Visual Studio that adds just a little bit of encouragement throughout your day.

Every time you save your document, this extension gives you an unobtrusive bit of good cheer and encouragement.

All credit for the idea goes to [Pat Nakajima](http://patnakajima.com/) who wrote Encourage for TextMate in about a line of code. For Visual Studio, it takes a LOT MORE THAN THAT!
Also thanks to @jaredpar for his help.
